_Part of the [New Challenge][nc]_

######_Today:_ sushi, food delivery, Scott Pilgrim vs the World, hibernation

##Person
On New Year's Eve, I hosted a Hackathon Hackers meetup, where I got to meet about 30 new people! It was really awesome putting real faces to the Facebook profiles I had interacted with. 

I was hosted by Luke, who is visiting New York from California!

My first new person of 2015 was Mike from Tumblr, who took Luke and I on a tour of the offices. Cool offices, cool people, in-depth tech discussions.

##Food/Drink
We got Chinese food, and this happened:

We had a lot of fun with that fish.

The next day, I had Artichoke. Oh my gosh. Best. Pizza. I felt very happy and very fat and proceeded to food coma. (I blame some of my procrastination in posting this on the pizza.)

##Music
A little weird. I'm not sure I could put a genre on this.

##Reading
I spent a lot of time on Medium reading posts. Some serious, some funny. I really like its recommendation system - there is always a new post that I'll be into.

##Picture
We had a meetup. Check out how cool we are:

##Writing

##Code
Not too much coding, but still working on freelance. I also did a couple designs for a project that I'll start coding next week.

######_Tomorrow:_ good food?
