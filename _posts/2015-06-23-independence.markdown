excerpt: "Today marks exactly 2 years of independent living. Jumping into the abyss of adulthood necessitates learning hard truths - fast."

Two years ago today, a 17-year-old me packed up the most important fraction of my belongings into two bags and left alone on a train to Montreal. Three days prior, I'd been wearing a 
red gown and walking across the stage at my graduation. 17 hours later, I'd be dropped alone in the centre of one of the largest cities in the country.

Blah blah

##Money

Being financially independent at 17 is fucking hard. Finding a job without work experience or connections, juggling two jobs and school, balancing debt and credit, and 
living off less than any person should have to is hard. I was better off than many, but I felt disadvantaged next to my peers. It was something I'd have to deal with in 
order to survive independently.

I was forced to quickly learn about resourcefulness and to live within my means. I worked a lot and cut out luxuries. I'm able to deal with not getting what I want - I 
have to earn and value everything.

Sometimes that wasn't enough. I dove into debt on multiple occassions and had to deal with the consequences of relying on resources I didn't have.

I also learned a lot about the generosity of people. In my darkest moments, I found help from others without asking. Somehow, subconsciously, kind people are able to 
identify struggle and provide aid that, while trivial to them, is lifechanging for someone else. It's a lesson I'll carry with me: as I become more stable, I become more 
able to help others.

##Education

I left home with the intention of attending university for four years on scholarship, getting a degree, and getting a job. I'm still not sure what my full educational path 
looks like, but let's just say that's not the case anymore.

Traditional education isn't for everyone, but never in my 17 years had I thought it wasn't for me. I did well in school, enjoyed my classes, and learned effectively by 
memorization and testing. That all ground to a halt when I was thrown into the whirlwind of jobs and obligations and needs that accompany the universty life. In order to 
keep myself afloat, I had to learn and grow at my own pace and on my own schedule. Throughout the last two years, I've done huge amounts of learning through projects, 
jobs, competitions, and mentorship. I learned that "education", in the typical sense of the word, does not encompass the broad spectrum of learning.



Education vs. learning
Mentorship
Project based
Connecting ideas across disciplines

##Happiness

Before leaving, I wouldn't have classified myself as a happy person.

Passion
New experiences
Belonging
Connection
