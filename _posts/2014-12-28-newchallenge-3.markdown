######_Today:_ coffee, big breakfast, trying to stay away from people, coworking space, $1 pizza, wild crowdedness, ritzy commercialism, the quest for Starbucks, sore muscles, financial district aimless wandering, high-class accommodations, tinder

##Person
This evening, I'm staying with the bright, young Jason, another Hackathon Hacker, who I learned dropped out of high school to work on his real estate startup. In his financial district apartment, I got to see him work (an allnighter) with 2 monitors and 5 windows open. This kid is going places.

##Food/Drink
Spending the afternoon walking around in Manhattan makes you hungry. Nothing quite fills the void like $1 pizza - a New York City staple. It was surprisingly delicious, and left me satisfied for quite a while. I can't even imagine how good it would taste when drunk.

##Music
This is how I'm winding down on this lovely Sunday evening:

##Reading
Very quick, very simple, very impactful, and very relevant to my current exploits.

_To move, to breathe, to fly, to float,_    
_To gain all while you give,_    
_To roam the roads of lands remote,_     
_To travel is to live._    

Hans Christian Anderson

##Writing
I promise, I did write 100 words today. However, it's part of a larger piece that I'll share later this week!

##Code
Again, basic blog stuff, but I added social icons to the top of my blog - learning about svg files in the process! I also changed up the font. (The code for this blog is always available on [github][gh]).

######_Tomorrow:_ Alley NYC, MLH, midtown
