_Part of the [New Challenge][nc]_

######_Today:_ Starbucks, Grand Central, Shake Shack, new friends, parks, lots of walking, nice views, Google maps failures, nice dinner, drunkeness.

##Person
I spent the entire day with three fabulous Binghamton hackers: Akshay, Carly, and Dan. Carly has an apartment in Manhattan (West Village), and she gave us a tour of several parts of the city - SoHo & the West Village, Washington Square Park, Union Square Park, High Line, and the World Trade Center (& memorial). We talked about topics all over the map (with a special emphasis on good food in New York and sexuality).

##Food/Drink
Today, I had the fast food gem of the northeast - Shake Shack. Portobello mushroom and cheese, coated and deep-fried, resting on a bed of lettuce, tomato, and mayo, and nested within a soft, buttery bun. OMG. Also, a chocolate shake. I cannot describe the happiness. However, I did feel pretty fat for the rest of the day.

##Music
Today's song comes from the [electro-swing playlist][playlist] I was listening to on the subway ride from Brooklyn to Manhattan. If you're not into electro-swing yet, you're about to be. Definitely my favourite genre of all time. This particular mix is just - yum. It samples a couple tracks that I remember from the Monopoly PC game back in the early 2000s, which was basically my first taste of New York, so it feels particularly vintage New York-y to me. (Side note: the street/metro names are monopoly spaces. LOL. I guess they had to come from somewhere.)

Anyone know of any cool electroswing clubs in NYC? I know it's big in Montreal - some of my best nights out have been swinging.

##Reading
This [poem][poem] was sent to me by Collin this morning. I'll include the whole text, because I think it's beautiful:

_All through that Sunday afternoon_    
_a kite flew above Sunday,_    
_a tightened drumhead, an armful of blown chaff._    

_I’d seen it grey and slippy in the making,_    
_I’d tapped it when it dried out white and stiff,_    
_I’d tied the bows of newspaper_   
_along its six-foot tail._   
  
_But now it was far up like a small black lark_   
_and now it dragged as if the bellied string_   
_were a wet rope hauled upon_   
_to lift a shoal._    

_My friend says that the human soul_   
_is about the weight of a snipe,_   
_yet the soul at anchor there,_    
_the string that sags and ascends,_   
_weigh like a furrow assumed into the heavens._   

_Before the kite plunges down into the wood_   
_and this line goes useless_    
_take in your two hands, boys, and feel_   
_the strumming, rooted, long-tailed pull of grief._   
_You were born fit for it._    
_Stand in here in front of me_    
_and take the strain._   

Kites, as a representation of life. I don't think I can remember the last time I flew one, myself. I'll have to make a point of doing that soon.

We were walking along the river at sunset. 'Nuff said.

##Writing
I said I'd give you 100 words, so here's over 100 words on all the walking I did today:

I like cities. One of the biggest draws - accessibility. Today, I took a walk across a good part of NYC. As much as I love public transit (expect another post soon), walking gives a unique perspective. Every shop, every person, and every block is a new experience that you can choose to pass by or to stop, and experience. Entire trajectories can be changed by taking a few turning steps. Sure, it's tiring, but it gives you new abilities - cutting through parks and buildings. My feet definitely have some blisters today, but getting to see the city block-for-block is more than worth it.

##Code
Today, I set up the drafts functionality on Jekyll, which allowed me to test this post before giving it to all of you. You can always check out this blog's code on [github][github].	

######_Tomorrow:_ I have no idea. Maybe brunch?
