_Part of the [New Challenge][nc]_

######_Today:_ AlleyNYC, almond milk and hipster coffee, MLH, thai, the Met, selfies and imitations, black coffee, arepas, coffee rum, Saskatchewan, 1am delivery pizza

##Person
Oh man, I met a lot of people today.

First up was the Major League Hacking team, some of whom I had met before. Always a chill time, and they have a sweet coworking space.

After that, I went on an adventure with two hackathon hackers: Ifeanyi and Samantha. We went to the Metropolitan museum and spoke broken English; check Facebook for hilarious Met photos to come later. I love that HH lets me meet up with people from all edges of the globe.

##Food/Drink
Lunch in midtown is always an adventure, but it's even better with MLH! I got to try some Thai food; I had Pad Kana (broccoli, kale, and tofu in a ginger sauce over rice) and Papaya salad. Both were delicious, even if my mouth was burning a little from the spice.

Later, I tried arepas (mine had cheese, plantain, and avocado). Also delicious.

I finished off the night with coffee rum - possibly one of the best things ever. Apparently it's only available in Portland, so I'll definitely be grabbing some while in Seattle.

I lied, that wasn't the end of the night. I conquered a pizza at 1am. Even crappy New York pizza is delicious.

##Music

##Reading
While at Starbucks, I got through a good amount of a pretty awesome [Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) as I try to brush up on my Ruby skills.

We went to the Met. It was puuurrrdyyy.

##Writing
Today is an exciting day for writing - I launched a [new Medium collection][waywo]! WAYWO (What Are You Working On?) is a common question and topic of discussion in the hacker community, and a Hackathon Hackers Facebook group dedicated to WAYWO has over 3.5K members. My new blog collection - [WAYWO This Week][waywo] - will summarize and review the most popular projects from the group each week. I'm really excited to share the great ideas of the hacker community. The [first post][writing] was published today. [Check out the collection now!][waywo]

##Code
I'm working on rails tutorials, so my code sadly isn't available yet! Soon!

######_Tomorrow:_ Undecided. Typical Ari Tuesday.
