_Part of the [New Challenge][nc]_

##Person

##Food/Drink
I didn't eat much today, but I _did_ try something new - a Milky Way Bar. My review? It's basically the same thing as a Mars Bar. Why do they both exist?

##Music
Thanks to Spotify for powering my new music discovery today. This new Modest Mouse track comes from the playlist [New Music Friday][spotify].

##Reading
On my long subway ride from Manhattan to Brooklyn, I read the history chapter of the Letters section of the book _Thinking with Type_, which was given to me as a Hackathon Hackers Secret Santa gift. I don't think I can express how much I like fonts and how fascinated I was looking through the history of typefaces.

##Picture
So, I went a little touristy with this. It was my first night in NYC - give me a break.

##Writing
I wrote an [artsy blog post][writing] today about feeling grown up this morning. Be sure to give it a look [here][writing].

##Code
Today, I set up this blog (using Jekyll) and implemented Google Analytics, AddThis social sharing, and Disqus commenting. Sure, not the most unique work I've done, but it was 5am and I did manage to get them all working together. You can find the code for this blog in its [github repository][github].
