_Part of the [New Challenge][nc]_

######_Yesterday:_ big-ass bagels, freelance, quest for ramen, weird mixed accents, cold parks, MEETUP, malls and loitering, subgrouping, Chinese food, freaky fish, cute tea house, whisky, Frozen

######_Today:_ sleeping in, brunch, Tumblr tour, walking, best damn pizza in the whole wide world, food coma

##Person
On New Year's Eve, I hosted a Hackathon Hackers meetup, where I got to meet about 30 new people! It was really awesome putting real faces to the Facebook profiles I had interacted with. 

I was hosted by Luke, who is visiting New York from California!

My first new person of 2015 was Mike from Tumblr, who took Luke and I on a tour of the offices. Cool offices, cool people, in-depth tech discussions.

##Food/Drink
We got Chinese food, and this happened:

We had a lot of fun with that fish.

The next day, I had Artichoke. Oh my gosh. Best. Pizza. I felt very happy and very fat and proceeded to food coma. (I blame some of my procrastination in posting this on the pizza.)

##Music
While staying with Luke, I've been listening to his Play it Forward Spotify playlist. It's a little heavier than what I'm used to, but parts of it are really awesome.

##Reading
I spent a lot of time on Medium reading posts. Some serious, some funny. I really like its recommendation system - there is always a new post that I'll be into.

We had a meetup. Check out how cool we are:

##Writing
I started on the next installment of [WAYWO This Week](http://medium.com/waywo-this-week)! It'll be released on Monday.

##Code
Not too much coding, but still working on freelance. I also did a couple designs for a project that I'll start coding next week.

######_Tomorrow:_ good food?
