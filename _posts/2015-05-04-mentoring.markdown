_Hackers, book a mentoring session [here][hackerchat]_

In the past year, I've become entirely immersed in tech. I went from learning what the heck a modulus was to getting flown to events and talking to dozens of people a day. I'm not an exceptional person by any means. I'm a product of an amazing culture of perpetual mentorship.

##Mentorship is changing.
Mentorship in the age of the hackathon is less formal. It's subconscious. It's perpetual.

Building a network of people with diverse skills and interests is now more important than trying to pair with a single guide. The hackathon community is comprised entirely of talented people who are constantly growing and learning. It's time that we take advantage of that and embrace mentorship as a part of our community culture.

## #MentorCulture
Let's make constant mentorship the default. 

1. Always be learning.
2. Ask for help often.
3. Share the things you've learned.

##Free Mentorship
If you want to try this mentorship thing, but aren't sure where to start, I've opened up several free mentorship sessions just for hackers. You can book them [here][hackerchat]. The permanent link is [http://ari.li/HackerChat][hackerchat]. I'd love to talk to you about anything, but I'm most useful for people wanting to learn front-end web (HTML/CSS/JS) the right way, looking to get into self-employment, thinking about dropping out, or seeking the internet's best hedgehog photos.

My original sessions (HackerChat beta, if you will) were inspired by my good friend Dave Fontenot's [http://bit.ly/chatwithdave](http://bit.ly/chatwithdave), where he will also talk to you about anything!

Hackers - take some time and teach your favourite technology, tell a story about a cool event or your first job, or give some candid feedback. You don't need to be an expert - just be open!

I'm looking forward to chatting with more and more of you. A special thank you to the hackers I've already spoken to - you inspire me to keep teaching and learning!
