It's almost the end of another year. 

###Challenge Me
Got an idea for something new I should try? New foods, new coding tools, new books, new anything? Throw your suggestions over to [Twitter][twitter] or leave them in the comments and I'll incorporate as many as I can!

_Follow the journey in real-time on [Twitter][twitter]!_
Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
